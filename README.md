# uiux-sandbox

- .sketch: Sketch design
- .snproject: Supernova project (imported .sketch file)

- [x] supernova-sandbox/: contains sketch and imported supernova project, also IOS and Android exports.
- [x] sketch-sandbox/: contains skecth apps.

## How To Start 
1. Download sketch.io
2. Download supernova.io
3. Download material.io plugin for sketch

or just watch [Demo App](https://github.com/tansudasli/uiux-sandbox/blob/master/demo-translator-app.mov)

## Strategy
- in generally using **Supernova** for code generation for IOS and Android is not working as expected. Missing exports, double xml lines etc..**That's totaly waste of time**.
